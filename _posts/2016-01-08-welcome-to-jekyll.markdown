This site is just a place where I write things down while I’m working.

Mostly notes from labs, CTFs, tools, and problems I run into. Some posts are short, some are longer, but everything here is written to help me remember what I did and why it worked or didn’t.

There’s no plan to make this polished or fancy. It’s simply a record of work in progress.
